# SyncSession
## Project Overview
Welcome to SyncSession, a powerful Chrome extension designed to enhance online collaboration by synchronizing web sessions in real-time. This extension allows users to extract session data from a host's webpage, broadcast it to a WebSocket server, and share the session data among all members. Real-time text communication is also facilitated, ensuring seamless interaction across all connected sessions.
## Objectives
- Enables real-time sharing of web sessions among multiple users
- Facilitates synchronised browsing and interaction on a hostâ€™s webpage.
## Technology Stack
- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Back-end**: WebSocket server
## Architecture

SyncSession seamlessly transfers sessions from one browser to another. It also works well for cross-device synchronization, as SyncSession's WebSocket server will be hosted on [Chameleon](https://app.imperial.learnchameleon.com).

## Text Sync on SyncSession
**Browser1 (Host):** Starts a session and begins broadcasting text updates.

**Browser2 (Member):** Connects to the session, sends and receives real-time text updates from other members.
